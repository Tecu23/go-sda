Common Data Structures and Algorithms using Arrays

### Algorithms

#### Sliding Window

\- [Maximum Average Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/description/)
\- [Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/description/)
\- [Permutaion in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/description/?envType=list&eId=xlep8di5)
\- count unique characters of all substrings of a given string

Practice and Apply:
\- substrings of size three with distinc characters
\- longest repeating character replacement
\- minimum size subarrat sum
\- longest substring without repeating character
\- sliding window maximum
\- minimum window substring
